## To use this api: Go to the root of the application, and run in terminal:

### `npm install`

### then run

### `npm run dev`

## You have succeeded in starting the server. You can then go to the the port that you get e.g localhost:5000/api/amz

### `localhost:5000/api/amz/orders` will give you access to all the orders available for your amazon seller account account
